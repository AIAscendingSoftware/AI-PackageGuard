Here is the detailed **step-by-step flow** for creating your custom action recognition model, focusing on detecting people throwing parcels or sitting on parcels in a warehouse. This flow outlines what you should do, which technology to use, and where to connect inputs and outputs for each stage of the process.

Steps to Follow After Detecting People with Parcels

1.Fine-Tune YOLO for Parcel-Holding Detection

Train YOLO to detect people specifically in the context of holding parcels. This can be done by collecting labeled data where individuals are shown with parcels in various scenarios.

2.Track Detected Individuals

Tool: Use DeepSORT or similar tracking algorithms.
Action:
Once a person with a parcel is detected, assign a unique ID to that individual.
Track their movement across frames to ensure continuity in monitoring their actions.

3.Monitor Actions

After tracking the individuals holding parcels, monitor their actions closely:
Pose Estimation: Use a pose estimation model (like OpenPose or MediaPipe) to analyze the body joints of the detected person.
Focus on arms and hands to see if they’re engaging in lifting, throwing, or placing actions.

4.Motion Analysis

Analyze the motion trajectory of the tracked individual:
Look for specific patterns indicative of throwing (e.g., sudden upward arm movements combined with a forward motion).
Consider using optical flow methods to analyze motion across frames.

5.Action Recognition

Tool: Implement Two-Stream CNN or I3D Networks.
Action:
Feed the data collected from the pose estimation and motion analysis into the action recognition model.
Classify the actions into categories like throwing, lifting, placing, and proper handling.

6.Sequence Analysis

Tool: Use LSTM for analyzing sequences of actions.
Action:
Evaluate the series of actions performed by the person over time to determine if they are throwing the parcel or handling it properly.
This can help capture context and confirm the action based on the preceding movements.

7.Implement Decision-Making Logic

Create logic to decide on actions based on the classified action:
If a person is classified as throwing a parcel, trigger an alert or record that incident.
If they are placing or handling the parcel properly, you may log that as acceptable behavior.

8.Post-Processing and Feedback

Continuously improve your detection and recognition algorithms based on false positives and false negatives observed during the monitoring.
Consider implementing feedback loops to adjust thresholds for action detection to reduce false positives over time.

----Why This Approach Works----

--Focused Detection: By detecting only those holding parcels, you reduce the overall data to be processed, focusing on likely cases of improper handling.
--Contextual Analysis: Combining pose estimation with action recognition allows for a deeper understanding of the individual’s interactions with parcels.
--Sequence Tracking: By tracking actions over time, you minimize false positives that could occur from isolated movements not indicative of improper handling.

----Overall Flow Recap----

1.Fine-tune YOLO for detecting individuals holding parcels.
2.Track those individuals using DeepSORT.
3.Monitor actions using pose estimation and motion analysis. 
4.Use action recognition models (Two-Stream CNN/I3D) for categorizing actions.
5.Employ LSTM for analyzing action sequences.
6.Implement decision-making logic to handle incidents.
7.Conduct post-processing to improve accuracy and performance.

   This approach will help you effectively monitor the actions of individuals with parcels and accurately detect improper handling (like throwing). Let me know if you have further questions or need clarification on any specific step!
